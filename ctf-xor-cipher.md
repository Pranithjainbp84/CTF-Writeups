🕵️ Incident:

The challenge involved decrypting a message encoded with an XOR cipher. The objective was to find the decryption key and recover the flag.

🔎 Investigation:

- Step 1: Analyzed the ciphertext and recognized that it was likely XOR-encrypted, as it exhibited characteristics of a simple cipher (i.e., irregular distribution of characters).
- Step 2: Assumed the key was a single byte, which is typical for XOR ciphers, and used a Python script to brute force the key.
- Step 3: Decrypted the message using different keys, revealing a hint that led us to a two-byte key.
- Step 4: With the correct key, the full flag was successfully decrypted.

🛡️ Mitigation:

- Step 1: Discussed the risks of weak cryptography algorithms, such as XOR cipher, in modern applications.
- Step 2: Suggested replacing XOR encryption with more secure algorithms such as AES.
- Step 3: Recommended the implementation of proper key management and salting to avoid cryptographic attacks like key guessing and brute-forcing.
