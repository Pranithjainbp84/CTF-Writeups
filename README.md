# CTF-Writeups

A collection of detailed write-ups from Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and security research. This repository contains solutions, analysis, and insights into various security challenges encountered during CTF events.

## Write-ups

### 1️⃣ Blue Team CTF - Log Analysis Challenge
**File**: [ctf-log-analysis.md]  
**Description**: A write-up detailing the solution to a Blue Team CTF challenge focused on log analysis. This write-up covers the steps taken to identify and analyze malicious activities from system logs.

### 2️⃣ Forensics CTF - Image Steganography Challenge
**File**: [ctf-image-steganography.md]  
**Description**: A detailed write-up of a forensic CTF challenge focusing on image steganography. This write-up walks through the process of extracting hidden messages embedded in image files using various steganography tools and techniques.

### 3️⃣ Web Security CTF - SQL Injection Challenge
**File**: [ctf-sql-injection.md]  
**Description**: A write-up detailing the solution to a web security CTF challenge centered around exploiting an SQL injection vulnerability. This challenge involved identifying and exploiting a vulnerable web application to extract sensitive data from a database.

### 4️⃣ Reverse Engineering CTF - Cracked Executable Challenge
**File**: [ctf-reverse-engineering.md]  
**Description**: A write-up describing the steps taken to reverse engineer a cracked executable in a CTF challenge. The challenge involved disassembling a binary file to find a flag hidden through obfuscation and cryptography techniques.

### 5️⃣ Cryptography CTF - XOR Cipher Decryption
**File**: [ctf-xor-cipher.md]  
**Description**: A write-up detailing the solution to a cryptography-based CTF challenge where the task was to decrypt a message encoded with an XOR cipher. The solution walks through the identification of the key and decryption process to retrieve the flag.
